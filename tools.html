	<h1>VBSP++</h1>	
	<pre>
VBSP++ is a modification of SDK2013 VBSP with various new features and improvements

Changelog:
- Automatically reduces brushes and brushsides usage of the map by 10-30%
- No t-junction limit
- No detail prop limit
- Raised overlay limit to 1024 and internal entity limit to 16384
- Added appid mounting if steam_appid.txt is present beside the exe
- Added support for mounting custom shaders in mods
- Added func_detail_blocker (like newer VBSPs)
- Added -blocksize (useful to compute visibility faster on open, large maps)
- Added -allowdynamicpropsasstatic (allows props without allowstatic in propdata to be used as static props)
- Added -forcevirtualmesh (allows properly compiling power of 4 displacements like CS:GO)
- Added parallax_obb entity support for mods that have parallax cubemaps
- Added %compileNoShadows
- Added func_nobevel support
	- VBSP generates bounding box brushsides for angled geometry to improve collision accuracy
	- But a problem is that these can eat up brushsides quickly
	- Surround angled brushes with this to skip creating these extra brushsides
	- Accurate collision isn't needed for areas the player can't reach anyway (like out of bounds)
- Added -nobevel (disables brushsides for all angled geometry. I do not recommend using this, use func_nobevel instead)
- func_occluder, func_areaportal, func_viscluster, func_nobevel, parallax_obb no longer count towards the brush limit
- Improved clarity of some warnings and removed useless warnings
- Fixed smoothing groups not working on func_detail
- Fixed displacements not being rotated correctly in instances
- Fixed missing texture cubemaps if skybox has mismatched side dimensions
- Fixed crash if an instance overflowed brush or brushsides limit

Installation:
Place into your game's bin/x64/ folder (where normal vbsp.exe is)
Update Hammer's game configuration to use vbspplusplus.exe as the BSP compiler

	<h1>file_to_nut</h1>	
	<pre>
Converts binary file to Squirrel array

Usage: drag and drop a file

<div class="patch">
	<h1>check_mdl</h1>	
	<pre>
Python script to check MDLs for corrupted vertex data
There is an unknown compiler bug where models very rarely have corrupt LOD data
Such corrupt models cause client crashes when decals are applied or users have lower graphics settings
This tool can identify those so they can be recompiled
Originally made to identify problematic props in the Greek Theme Pack for TF2

Usage: install Python, run the script inside a folder of models you want to check

<div class="patch">
	<h1>cubemap2hdr</h1>	
	<pre>
Converts a cubemap in LDR color format to HDR
Particularly useful for Left 4 Dead 2 where LDR cubemaps will look broken

Usage: drag and drop a cubemap onto the exe
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ficool2/misc_tools/releases/download/v1/cubemap2hdr.exe">Download</a> (Last updated: November 11th, 2024)

<div class="patch">
	<h1>tga2skybox</h1>	
	<pre>
Converts 6 tga files into a cubemap VTF, and automatically creates a LDR and HDR version

	<h1>vtf_downscale</h1>	
	<pre>
CLI tool to downscale a VTF to a lower mipmap losslessly. Useful to reduce file size without re-compressing the texture
Supports mass-automatic downscaling (for example to only downscale all 2048x2048 or higher textures)

Usage: run from cmd to see help options

<div class="patch">
	<h1>vtfstripalpha</h1>	
	<pre>
CLI tool to remove the alpha channel from VTFs without quality loss. Useful to reduce file size
Supports mass-automatic detection and removal of blank (white) alpha channels
Unfortunately, I lost the source code for this tool...
