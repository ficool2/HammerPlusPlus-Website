	<h1>VBSP++</h1>	
	<pre>
VBSP++ is a modification of SDK2013 VBSP with various new features and improvements

Changelog:

- Automatically reduces brushes and brushsides usage of the map by 10-30% (MAX_MAP_BRUSHES, MAX_MAP_BRUSHSIDES)
- Automatically reduces vertex usage of the map by 10-30% (MAX_MAP_VERTS)
   - Note: this reduction will be applied once the map exceeds the limit only, as a safety measure
   - You can also use the new "-cullverts" parameter to always reduce verts even if the limit isn't exceeded
- Automatically reduces planes usage of the map up to 40% if limit is hit (MAX_MAP_PLANES)
	- If plane limit is exceeded, VRAD++ must be used or lighting will be broken
- No t-junction limit
- No detail prop limit
- Raised overlay limit to 8192 and internal entity limit to 65536
- Increased maximum switchable lights from 32 to 96
- "-leaktest" is now enabled by default, i.e. stops compile on leaks
	- Added "-noleaktest" to disable this behavior
- Added appid mounting in gameinfo.txt
- Added support for mounting custom shaders in mods
- Added support for custom $surfaceprops on clip brushes
- Added support for compiling 4-way blends (for games that support it)
- Added func_detail_blocker (like newer VBSPs)
- Added -blocksize (default is 1024)
	- Useful to compute visibility faster on open, large maps like surf (I recommend 2048)
	- Using a higher blocksize also reduces your vertex count, useful to circumvent vertex limit
- Added -allowdynamicpropsasstatic (allows any props to used as static props)
	- Note that some props might work right with this, particularly props that aren't compiled with "$staticprop"
- Added per-prop ambient occlusion toggle
    - To use, set "disableambientocclusion 1" keyvalue on the entity
    - Does not work on HL2/Singleplayer BSPs due to older static prop format
- Added proper support for compiling power of 4 displacements (like CS:GO)
	- Update: this is now reverted due to causing crashes on Linux servers. Slammin is also affected by this.
- Added parallax_obb entity support for mods that have parallax cubemaps
- Added func_detail_illusionary (identical to func_detail but non solid)
- Added func_nobevel support
	- VBSP generates bounding box brushsides for angled geometry to improve collision accuracy
	- But a problem is that these can eat up brushsides quickly
	- Surround angled brushes with this to skip creating these extra brushsides
	- Accurate collision isn't needed for areas the player can't reach anyway (like out of bounds)
	- You can also specifiy a "vbsp_nobevel" 1 keyvalue in a brush entity to disable bevels
- Added -nobevel (disables brushsides for all angled geometry. I do not recommend using this, use func_nobevel instead)
- Added optimization to automatically disable vertex lighting for props with $bumpmap/$phong
	- Reduces time spent in VRAD with -staticproplighting
	- Use "-showineligiblevertexlitprops" to show what props were marked ineligible for vertex lighting
- Added logging if FGD has parsing errors
- Added -nonamefixup to disable default instance name prefixing with "InstanceAuto"
- Added "-singleplayer" option to compile maps for  HL2 (SDK13 Singleplayer) BSP format
- Added warning if using info_lighting on dynamic entities
- Added sanity check for NaN/Inf values in the VMF
- Added check for brushes going outside of map grid
    - This prevents the "Map coordinate extents are too large!!" error in-game
- Added %compileNoShadows support
- Added support for compiling lightmaps on Water if $lightmapwaterfog is set
- Added support for high lightmap sizes (useful for games that support -maxlightmapdim)
- Added support for saving "enablelightbounce" flag for static props
- Added support for reading decimal values from face lightmap scales
- Added -nohdrcubemap to not write HDR cubemaps to BSP, useful if map is compiled in LDR only
    - Likewise -noldrcubemap exists to not write LDR cubemaps
- Added "-nobump" (disables bumpmap lightmaps on all faces)
- Added "-maxluxelscale" (clamps maximum luxel scale, default is no limit)
- Added "-report_search_paths" to list current search paths for debugging
- "-leaktest" will now stop on areaportal leaks
- Restored support for -maxlightmapdim and -defaultluxelsize parameters
- func_occluder, func_areaportal, func_viscluster, func_nobevel, parallax_obb no longer count towards the brush limit
- Improved clarity of some warnings and removed useless ones
- Renamed waterindices to primindices (less misleading name)
- Fixed instances not collapsing correctly if FGD had unrecognized types
- Fixed instance names prefixed with ! being remapped
- Fixed remapped instance I/O always using ESC separators (fixes HL2 compatibility)
- Fixed smoothing groups not working on func_detail
- Fixed displacements not being rotated correctly in instances
- Fixed occluders not being collapsed correctly in instances
- Fixed missing texture cubemaps if skybox has mismatched side dimensions
- Fixed crash if an instance overflowed brush or brushsides limit
- Fixed crash if instance name was too long
- Fixed crash if no surfaceprops were loaded
- Fixed crash if map had more than 32768 texinfo
- Fixed crash if displacement face had less than 3 points
- Fixed bug where brushside count was varying depending on the CPU

Installation:

Place into your game's bin/x64/ or bin/win64/ folder (where normal vbsp.exe is)
Update Hammer's game configuration to use vbspplusplus.exe as the BSP compiler

Supported branches:
- Garry's Mod
- 64-bit SDK2013-based games, etc: Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch

Compiling maps for Half-Life 2 or SDK 2013 Singleplayer is supported
However you must still install VBSP++ in a 64-bit game, and pass "-singleplayer" to set the correct BSP format

Optionally, add the "tools_plusplus.fgd" FGD file into Hammer's game configuration
Tools -> Options -> Game Configurations -> click Add beside Game Data files

<div class="patch">
	<h1>VRAD++</h1>	
	<pre>
VRAD++ is a modification of SDK2013 VRAD with various new features and improvements

Changelog:

- Scales up to 64 threads
- Small performance optimizations
- Shared LDR/HDR compiling:
	- When using -both, LDR lighting data will be redirected to HDR at no extra file size cost
	- This means you don't need to compile VRAD twice for LDR and HDR users anymore (compatible with both)
	- Passing in -ldr or -hdr will still explicitly compile in LDR or HDR mode only, respectively
	- HDR data will not be remapped if LDR data is already present
	- Therefore if you need different LDR and HDR lighting, compile with -ldr and -hdr separately
		- NOTE: before the 22/10/25 update, VRAD++ would run in HDR mode by Default
		- This has been reverted to stock behavior, with LDR mode being default
		- Only -both will do the data remapping
		- This was done for compatibility with other branches which VRAD++ is being ported to
- Bypassed "numplanes + fakeplanes >= MAX_MAP_PLANES" limit
	- You will never see it again!
- Light count is now unlimited instead of capped at 8192
- Added appid mounting in gameinfo.txt
- Added shadow casting for dynamic props
	- Set "vrad_model_cast_shadows 1" in the entity to enable this
	- This is intended for props that won't move and can't be a static prop, for example resupply lockers in TF2
	- Uses the first frame of sequence 0, or uses the animation set by "DefaultAnim" (like on "prop_dynamic")
	- Modelscale is supported
- Added new "light_projected" light type
	- Behaves like a env_projectedtexture but applied at compile time to lightmaps
	- Same properties as light_spot, with an additional texturename key (path to VTF)
	- Outer angle controls "size" of projected angle
	- Alpha channel is multiplied with the output light (black - no light contribution)
	- Non-square aspect ratios and roll angle are supported
	- Renamed to "light_spot" after compilation so it can be toggled in-game
- Added support for "light_directional" light type
	- Renamed to "light_spot" after compilation so it can be toggled in-game 
- Added ambient occlusion baking
	- Custom implementation that is an order of magnitude faster than AO in Slammin/CS:GO (!)
	- Set -ambientocclusion or -ao to enable this
	- Customize with -aoradius, -aoscale, -aopropsamples, -aofacesamples
	- Samples are automatically adjusted for -fast and -final mode
	- Default AO radius and scale is 32 units and 0.5 respectively
	- Radius in 3D sky is correctly scaled (every other VRAD AO implementation has this bug)
	- Use "-aodebug" to visualize ambient occlusion	
- Added new QMC sampler for ambient, sunlight and ambient occlusion
    - This allows lighting to converage to the ground truth faster
    - Same sampler as used by modern raytracers, such as in Blender
    - Less samples are required for a good result
    - Since less samples are required, "-final" has now been reduced to "-extrasky 8" by default (from 16)
- Added soft lights
    - When "_light_radius" keyvalue on a light is set, the light is treated as a sphere/disk
    - Allows for casting softer shadows
    - Note that soft lights will take longer to compile than hard lights
    - Added "-extrasoft" parameter to control sample multiplier for soft lights
        * Defaults are 1, 0.25 on "-fast", 4 on "-final"
    - Currently only supports "light" and "light_spot"
- Added "-StaticPropSampleScale"
	- Controls sample multiplier for prop vertex lighting (default is 1)
	- Defaults to 4 with "-final", which will slightly increase compile times
	- However this will improve quality of prop lighting in areas starved of sunlight or bounced surfaces
- Added -reflectivityscale
- Added -worldtextureshadows
	- Allows $alphatest brush textures to cast proper shadows like props
	- Requires -textureshadows
	- Fixed bug where textureshadows doesn't work if top-left pixel is opaque
- Added -translucentshadows
	- Similar to -worldtextureshadows but for $translucent brush textures
	- Requires -textureshadows and -worldtextureshadows
- Added -forcetextureshadows
	- Forces texture shadows to be enabled on all props
- Added DXT3 format support for texture shadows
- Added support for %alphatexture
	- Allows overriding texture used for texture shadows on geometry
- Added experimental support for static props to shadow ambient cubes
    - Disabled by default, use "-propambient" to enable
    - Uses collision model of the static prop as the approximation
    - Ambient cubes won't be generated inside solid static props
    - Vertex lighting from the props will contribute to the ambient cubes 
        - "-StaticPropLighting" does not need to be enabled
    - Note that this won't solve sunlight applying to entities shadowed by static props, as the engine ignores prop visiblity at runtime
    - See <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-requests/issues/2932#issuecomment-3691574043">this page</a>for detailed info about this issue
- Added experimental support for named "light_environment" and "light_directional"
    - Fixes static props having black lighting
    - To use: you must "jail" the light entity by itself inside a nodraw cube in the void
    - Not doing so will potentially lead to bad performance
    - Named light environment still has engine bugs, mainly that props may have broken light after toggling the sunlight
    - This can be workarounded by flipping the value of "r_radiosity" in console 
         - In GMod, Lua can be used for this
         - In singleplayer games, you can issue a command with "point_clientcommand" or VScript
- Added support for "Patch" materials for loadng texture shadows
- Added support for processing  HL2 (SDK13 Singleplayer) BSP formats
- Added "-patchlightmapsize" to set minimum lightmap size for patches (default is 16)
	- This controls how faces with lower lightmap scales get subdivided for bounced lighting
	- Lower values will subdivide more, at the cost of increased compile time and memory usage
	- This may sometimes solve issues with thin surfaces obstructed by geometry not receiving light
- Added "-choptexlights"
	- Allows subdivision of faces that have texlights
	- Can create more smoother-looking lights from faces but may take longer to compute
- Added support for using decimals in lightmap scales
- Added "-report_search_paths" to list current search paths for debugging
- Added "-propdebug" for tracking down what props take a long time to compile
- Significantly improved performance and memory usage of bounced lighting on faces with low lightmap scales
- Slightly improved displacement bounced lighting to be more granular
     - Benefits thin/small displacements the most
     - Added "-DisplacementLightingOld" to use old calculations
- Improved vertex lighting for props
	- Added -StaticPropIndirectMode to use old behavior if desired
	- See <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/pull/1345">this page</a> for a comparison
- Fixed maps with more than 13 million triangles taking a very, very long time to compile
- Fixed rays missing exact diagonal corner intersections
	- Both of these bug exists in all other versions of VRAD
- Fixed prop lightmaps being dumped into wrong color space with "-dumppropmaps"
	- Prop lightmaps are also now dumped into "sp_lightmaps" directory of the game
- Fixed prop lightmaps always using "fast" lighting samples and ignoring "-extrasky"
	- As a result, prop lightmaps will take slightly longer to compile, but will look significantly better
- Fixed maps with radial vis (FarZ set in "env_fog_controller") drawing 3D sky in 2Dsky-only areas
- Fixed light_environment SunSpreadAngle not using more samples under "-final"
    - Maps using a spread angle greather than 0 will take slightly longer to compile with "-extrasky" as a result, but the result looks better compared to stock
- Redundant vertex lighting is skipped for lightmapped props (saves compile time and file size)
- .dx90.vtx data is loaded for vertex lighting instead of .dx80.vtx
- Broken vertex data for props will now be skipped over when compiling
- Fixed bug where broken vertex data in props skipped vertex lighting for other props
- Removed memory column from BSP statistics as its useless
- Named or styled lights are now sorted by brightness priority for faces
	- Reduces occurence of bad lighting from overlapping named/styled lights
- Static prop lighting is no longer skipped on "-fast" mode
- Added -scale, -ambient, -dlight, -sky, -notexscale, -coring debug options
- Unlimited texlight support in .rad files
- Comments in .rad files are now skipped
- Cleaned up formatting of some messages and warnings
