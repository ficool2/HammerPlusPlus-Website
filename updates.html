	<h1>Build 8863 (October 31st 2022)</h1>
	<pre>
- Added convex + hole checker for brushes. This will catch invalid brushes that Hammer wouldn't pick up as invalid before, but could have caused VBSP to die (such as with the infamous "BSP unbounded" error)
	- Note: Ssome maps may get reported as having invalid solids when they previously wouldn't. If these are inspected closely, very tiny edges or holes  can be discovered. A simple fix is to select all vertices and snap them to grid to make it valid again, or remake the brush.
- Added textured sprite icons in 2D view. On by default, this can be toggled off in options
- Added trajectory visualizer for trigger_catapult
- Added angles visualizer for env_blood, env_physimpact, env_entity_maker, func_movelinear, func_button, func_door, func_conveyor, info_projecteddecal, phys_thruster, shadow_control, trigger_apply_impulse, trigger_push, trigger_wind
- CSGO: Added vgui_world_text_panel preview
- Added option to change number of digits for texture precision, default is 4
- Added option to disable DPI scaling. If you had problems with wonky UI scaling before, disabling this should help
- Improved brush precision slightly in edge cases
- Improved performance when vertex manipulating a large displacement with detail sprites
- Significantly improve speed of Keyword filtering in the texture browser
- CSGO: Fixed model browser input being stuck if CTRL or SHIFT or ALT were held when exiting
- Fixed wrong working directory for the compiler window when executing thirdparty files
	- As a result, the full filename workaround is no longer needed for tools such as Propper. Simply typing in 'propper' will now work
- Fixed brushes with less than 4 faces not being reported as invalid
- Fixed crash when vertex manipulating displacements and editing them afterwards
- Fixed crash when box selecting with vertex manipulation, pressing enter and then holding left click
- Fixed displacement duplication bug due to vertex manipulation
- Fixed crash when undoing displacements after certain operations
- Fixed undo not preserving all displacements for certain operations

- Fixed .ogg files not being playable (for source mods that support it)
- Fixed missing texture not appearing on sprites

<div class="patch">
	<h1>Build 8851: Major update (January 21st 2022)</h1>
	<pre>
- Added Lighting Preview
	- Simulate Source's iconic lighting right inside the editor
	- High accuracy and reasonably fast when compared to VRAD
	- Efficiently multithreaded, the more threads your CPU has the faster it will be
	- Dynamic, fast updating of point lights and spotlights is supported
	- Bakes can be done globally (full bake) or only in a certain radius
	- Options configurable include:
		- Dynamic Updating: Toggle automatically updating when changing a point light or spotlight
		- Update Delay: The delay in seconds before updating automatically
		- Texlight Filename: Custom .rads file used for texture lights. The lights.rad and .rad file is loaded automatically
		- Sun Samples: The quality of sunlight, higher is better but slower
		- Ambient Samples: The quality of ambient environmental lighting, higher is better but MUCH slower
		- Visibility Samples: The quality of visibility testing for lights, higher is more accurate but much slower
		- Light Radius Scale: Multiplier for how far a light can "see". Lowering this can make bakes faster but less accurate
		- Light Brightness Scale: Multiplier of brightness for all lights
		- Ambient Occlusion Scale: If non-zero, ambient occlusion will be baked. This is expensive, so it's off by default!
		- Bounced Light: Bounces light so areas that a light can't see will still receive light. Only re-baked on full bakes
		- Light Bleed Hack: Attempts to fix light bleeding through walls due to the nature of Hammer geometry
		- Cubemap: Toggle rendering of the cubemap, as it can be distracting in certain situations
	- Current limitations:
		- Dynamic updating of geometry doesn't exist yet, use radius bake for now
		- Instances are not supported (soon)
		- Texture shadows are not supported
		- Detail sprites and ropes show as fullbright
		- CSGO: cascaded shadow mapping (CSM) is not rendered (soon!)
- Added Create Instance from Selection tool

- Added 3D skybox preview
	- To use: convert your 3D skybox section into an instance (use the new Convert Selection to Instances tool for this)
	- The instance must have a sky_camera entity, otherwise it will not register as a 3D sky
	- 3D skybox should now appear at real scale in your main map. Toggle the preview on/off with the toolbar button
	- Fog preview is also supported in the 3D skybox
- Added Instance Preview
	- Main VMF will now be shown while editing an instance
	- Accessible via the new "Edit Instance with Preview" button or by middle clicking an instance in 3D view
	- Note: 3D sky preview does not work properly in combination with this yet
