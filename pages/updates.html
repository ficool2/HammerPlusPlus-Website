   <h1>Build 8851: Major update (January 21st 2022)</h1>
   <pre>
- Added Lighting Preview
- Simulate Source's iconic lighting right inside the editor
- High accuracy and reasonably fast when compared to VRAD
- Efficiently multithreaded, the more threads your CPU has the faster it will be
- Dynamic, fast updating of point lights and spotlights is supported
- Bakes can be done globally (full bake) or only in a certain radius
- Options configurable include:
   - Dynamic Updating: Toggle automatically updating when changing a point light or spotlight
   - Update Delay: The delay in seconds before updating automatically
   - Texlight Filename: Custom .rads file used for texture lights. The lights.rad and .rad file is loaded automatically
   - Sun Samples: The quality of sunlight, higher is better but slower
   - Ambient Samples: The quality of ambient environmental lighting, higher is better but MUCH slower
   - Visibility Samples: The quality of visibility testing for lights, higher is more accurate but much slower
   - Light Radius Scale: Multiplier for how far a light can "see". Lowering this can make bakes faster but less accurate
   - Light Brightness Scale: Multiplier of brightness for all lights
   - Ambient Occlusion Scale: If non-zero, ambient occlusion will be baked. This is expensive, so it's off by default!
   - Bounced Light: Bounces light so areas that a light can't see will still receive light. Only re-baked on full bakes
   - Light Bleed Hack: Attempts to fix light bleeding through walls due to the nature of Hammer geometry
   - Cubemap: Toggle rendering of the cubemap, as it can be distracting in certain situations
