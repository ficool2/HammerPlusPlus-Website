<div class="patch">
	<h1>Build 8868 (July 28th 2024)</h1>
	<pre>
- Added UV lock tool, behaves identically to JACK editor's UV tool
	- Toggle it from the new toolbar button
	- When enabled, textures are "locked" in place when moving vertices in vertex edit mode
	- This allows you to easily skew brushes without the old trignometry or vector workarounds!
- Rebranded Propper to Propper++
- Added support for merging models in Propper++
	- Useful to combine static props to reduce draw calls
	- Skins, bodygroups and scale are baked in
	- You can also bake a singular model by itself
- Added support for scaling along X Y Z individually in Propper++
	- Negative values are accepted, you can use this to mirror props now
- Experimental support for generating lightmap atlases in Propper++
	- This allows prop_static lightmaps to be used when normally not possible
	- See the documentation for more details
- Official documentation for Propper++ is now hosted on Valve Wiki:
	- <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Hammer++/Propper++">https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Hammer++/Propper++</a>
	- Added a Help button to Propper++ that opens this page
- Added option to set $casttextureshadows in Propper++

<div class="patch">
	<h1>Build 8867 (July 2nd 2024)</h1>
	<pre>
- Hotfix for model browser/color picker killing the renderer in Garry's Mod after July 1st update
- Restored support for engine -> Hammer communication via the "map_edit" command 
	- In Garry's Mod, this also makes hammer.SendCommand work now
	- Unlike stock Hammer, Hammer++ ignores map version checking and will always allow a map to be edited 
- Added "Import" button to Expert Compile window, allows importing commands from a .cfg
- Added "Remove bad collision faces" to Propper (on by default), removes thin/tiny collision faces
	- This fixes complex brushwork sometimes creating a shrinkwrapped collision model
- Added support for handling _rt_camera0, _rt_camera1 and _rt_camera2 textures (for Mapbase)
- Added Refract material rendering
- Added 2D view option to change default rotation angle (15 degrees)
- Added 2D view option to change scaling interval for the grid, default is x2
	- Note that it renders in low resolution for performance reasons
- HDR Lighting Preview now uses a half-brightness lightmap for fullbright materials	
	- Tool textures such as nodraw should no longer make you blind
- TF2: Quotation marks ("") in RunScriptCode inputs are now automatically replaced with backticks (`)
- Improved clipping tool performance on large maps
- Lighting preview settings are now hidden by default
- Missing material thumbnails now show up as the purple checkerboard instead of solid black
- Removed "Autosaving..." popup
	- Fixes input being stolen while flying around with the camera
- Autosaving will no longer occur when the 3D camera is moving
- Limited thumbnails in texture browser to max 16:1 aspect ratio
	- This allows disproportional textures like 2048x32 to still be recognizable
- Fixed flickering in lighting preview with post processing on
- Fixed "Show Alpha" in texture browser still showing textures as transparent when turned off
- Fixed sorting issues with the overlay box model
- Fixed resizing brush entities with direction helpers (e.g. func_door or func_button) being wonky

- Fixed wrong thumbnail size for skybox textures in texture browser
- Fixed HDR-only skyboxes not being previewed in texture browser
- Fixed corrupted texture thumbnail appearing when selecting a missing material
- Fixed grid rendering precision, particularly at sub-unit scale

- Fixed wrong texture size for _rt_camera in TF2, now matches ingame
- Fixed Hammer++ freezing on load if an FGD had an incorrectly closed quote containing an operator
	- This is also an issue in stock Hammer
- Fixed a crash if an invalid last texture name was saved in the texture list
- Fixed normal camera moving while under the influence of Jumpman
<br>
- KNOWN BUGS:
	- Copying entities from a VMF that is closed might crash
	  Workaround: Don't close the VMF until you have finished pasting
	</pre>
</div>				
			
<div class="patch">
	<h1>Build 8866 (May 19th 2024)</h1>
	<pre>
- Added native Propper tool
	- Converts selected brushes/displacements to a model automatically
	- Works on all games and serves as a replacement for the old standalone Propper tool
	- Access it from Tools -> Propper or Ctrl + Shift + P
	- Brushes tied to an entity or grouped together will be converted into a single mesh
	- Unlike the old Propper, this converts the Hammer mesh directly so there is no destructive loss from the BSP process
	- The tool is a two-step process: Build and Compile
	- If you want to add extra model properties like prop_data, Build it first, edit the generated QC and then Compile
	- Note: the studiomdl.exe path won't be automatically configured unless you are on a fresh install
	- Make sure to configure the MDL program in Tools -> Options -> Build Programs first
- Added support for HDR lighting preview (on by default)
	- Improved lighting quality in dark interiors
	- Includes post-processing preview: change tonemap, bloom, color correction and vignette settings
	- Left 4 Dead 2: This fixes lighting preview brightness being very inaccurate in dark areas, as the game uses up to x8 tonemap scaling by default!
	- Left 4 Dead 2: 2D skybox preview will now show HDR skyboxes correctly
	- Moved Map -> Set Color Correction to lighting preview's options
	- When a map is loaded for the first time, bloom/tonemap settings are copied from the first found env_tonemap_controller 
	- If there is multiple env_tonemap_controllers, the one with "global" in the name is favored first
	- LDR mode can be re-enabled in Tools -> Options -> Hammer++ (not recommended)
- Upgraded texture browser to display WorldVertexTransition blends automatically
	- %tooltexture is now ignored on WorldVertexTransition materials for this reason
- Added transparency display for $additive materials in the texture browser
- Added error message in compile window when a command fails from missing dependencies or wrong architecture
- Added error message in compile window when attempting to run hl2.exe on 64-bit TF2
- Added error message in compile window if VVIS fails potentially due to a leak
- Added extra info on showing compile window errors to other people
- Added warning message if resource files for model/particle browser are missing (they will crash without them)
- Loading a pointfile will now center camera on the exit point 
- Pointfiles will now select the (brush) entity responsible for the leak when loaded
- Increased pointfile color saturation
- Added slider for Near Clipping Plane in Options -> 3D views
	- Increasing this allows reducing z-fighting when observing very large maps
- Added exception address to crash message
- Updated model ambient sampling in lighting preview
	- Now samples nearby lightmaps, this should make them look better inside (dark) interiors
- Changed I/O delimiter in Garry's Mod to use ESC rather than commas by default
	- Should fix issues with instance I/O
- Raised compile parameter length limit from 260 to 8192 (maximum length allowed by Windows)
- Increased max back clipping plane, model render distance and detail render distance from 32768 to 99999
- Brushes tied to entities can longer be used in the Merge tool (move them to world first)
	- This fixes issues with phantom brushes which then caused a crash
- Changed model browser background color to match particle browser (darker)
- Clarified the "Failed to load engine dlls" error that it may happen if an antivirus quarantined the files
- Hammer++ now uses it's own default cubemap in materials/dev_test/cubemap
- Jumpman has learned to swim
- Removed visibility options from lighting preview
- Fixed compile window not reading parameters correctly if "Wait for Keypress" was disabled

- Texture browser now uses less memory and displays textures faster
- Fixed physics tool freezing on certain hardware in Left 4 Dead 2
- Fixed incorrect default gameconfig paths for Left 4 Dead 2
- Fixed water textures having a missing texture reflection in Left 4 Dead 2
- Fixed a 2 pixel wide yellow corner appearing when selecting objects in Left 4 Dead 2

	- More specifically, fixed models crashing if they used non-conventional $keyvalues formatting
- Fixed collision models not displaying in the model browser in Garry's Mod
- Fixed wobbly camera movement because Hammer++ performance was too high
- Fixed hotloaded models not updating their bounding box correctly

- Fixed Discord rich presence crashing if booting with -nomessagewnd
- Fixed Jumpman exploding when entering a map on 32-bit
<br>
- KNOWN BUG: The texture thumbnails in the dropdown list don't render
	- As a workaround, use the up/down arrow keys to see them for now
	</pre>
</div>			
			
<div class="patch">
	<h1>Build 8865 (April 21st 2024)</h1>
	<pre>
- Added experimental Garry's Mod and Left 4 Dead 2 support
	- Portal 2 support still has some problems, this will be released at a later date
- Added 64-bit support for Garry's Mod and Team Fortress 2
- Added Occlusion Culling
	Provides significant framerate improvement, particularly on indoor heavy maps
	Can be disabled in Options if it causes issues
- Added env_sun preview
	- In Garry's Mod, this will also show phong on brushes
- Added preview for TF2's version of point_worldtext
- Added direction helper to light_environment, light_directional and env_fog_controller
- Added check for missing texture overlays in Check for Problems
- Added model name when 'Missing/invalid model name' is found in Check for Problems
- Added Show Alpha button to texture browser

- Added support for loading Jolt physics engine via "vphysics_jolt.dll" if started with -jolt parameter
- Added displacement filters to download and moved their directory to "hammerplusplus/filters/"
	- This was needed as some games did not ship filters for 64-bit
- Added shader fix for WorldVertexTransition blend modulate textures for SDK2013
- Added shader fix for Sprites rendering through walls on Garry's Mod and SDK2013
- Added toggleable support for 4 way displacement blends (default is off)
	- To enable, open hammerplusplus_settings.ini and change Enable4WayBlends under [General] to true
	- The Blend button under Sculpt will now be enabled, and the extra information will be read and saved in VMFs
	- NOTE: The game itself must support this feature for it to work! 
	  The blends will not show up in Hammer++ unless shader support is present
	  If shaders are implemented to show 4WayBlends under Garry's Mod, this will serve as support for Black Mesa
- VMFs can be drag and dropped (like Garry's Mod Hammer)
- Pointfiles are now rainbow gradient colored. This allows you to more easily see where it starts and ends
- Upgraded compile window to inform if a command failed, and the total time is now shown
- Significantly reduced memory usage for baking bounced lighting on large maps with high number of threads
- Enabled precise floating point math, should slightly help with brush precision
- Disabled brush convexity checker due to false positives
	- VBSP tends to allow wonky brushes like that more often than not
- !nick, !rochelle, !ellis, !coach, !bill, !zoey, !louis and !francis targetnames are recognized as valid targetnames
- Fixed detail sprites materials breaking after modifying a displacement
- Fixed lighting preview only creating displacement shadows from the backside
	- Now matches VRAD behavior, both sides will block shadows
	- Prop lighting preview may look downgraded due to this change, particularly with rocks inside displacements
	  This can be workarounded by setting prop lighting origins to a better info_lighting place
	  Lighting origins won't affect VRAD because it uses per-vertex lighting
- Fixed quick texture list dropdown going up by default, it will now try go down whenever possible
- Fixed textures longer than 128 characters being truncated in texture browser
- Fixed broken color picker layout
- Fixed useless Half Life 2 config being generated for Team Fortress 2 on first time use

	</pre>
</div>			
			
<div class="patch">
	<h1>Build 8863 (October 31st 2022)</h1>
	<pre>
- Added convex + hole checker for brushes. This will catch invalid brushes that Hammer wouldn't pick up as invalid before, but could have caused VBSP to die (such as with the infamous "BSP unbounded" error)
	- Note: some maps may get reported as having invalid solids when they previously wouldn't. If these are inspected closely, very tiny edges or holes  can be discovered. A simple fix is to select all vertices and snap them to grid to make it valid again, or remake the brush.
- Added textured sprite icons in 2D view. On by default, this can be toggled off in options
- Added trajectory visualizer for trigger_catapult
- Added angles visualizer for env_blood, env_physimpact, env_entity_maker, func_movelinear, func_button, func_door, func_conveyor, info_projecteddecal, phys_thruster, shadow_control, trigger_apply_impulse, trigger_push, trigger_wind
- CSGO: Added vgui_world_text_panel preview
- Added option to change number of digits for texture precision, default is 4

- Improved performance when vertex manipulating a large displacement with detail sprites
- Significantly improve speed of Keyword filtering in the texture browser
- CSGO: Fixed model browser input being stuck if CTRL or SHIFT or ALT were held when exiting
- Fixed decals/overlays flickering if the material does not have $decal 1 (these work fine in-game)
- Fixed wrong working directory for the compiler window when executing thirdparty files
	- As a result, the full filename workaround is no longer needed for tools such as Propper. Simply typing in 'propper' will now work
- Fixed brushes with less than 4 faces not being reported as invalid
- Fixed crash when vertex manipulating displacements and editing them afterwards
- Fixed crash when box selecting with vertex manipulation, pressing enter and then holding left click
- Fixed displacement duplication bug due to vertex manipulation
- Fixed crash when undoing displacements after certain operations
- Fixed undo not preserving all displacements for certain operations
- Fixed detailsprites persisting after destroying a displacement
- Fixed ragdolls appearing at map origin if invalid pose was specified by the mapper
- Fixed rare idle crash related to Discord rich presence (migrated to new Discord SDK)
- Fixed certain cases of random rendering crashes
- Fixed prop_static modelscale updating out of sync in lighting preview
- Fixed .ogg files not being playable (for source mods that support it)
- Fixed missing texture not appearing on sprites
- Fixed missing texture sprites being super tiny
- Reverted I/O performance changes to an earlier build. This should fix the rare situation where entities were unintentionally swapped

	<h1>Build 8851: Major update (January 21st 2022)</h1>
	<pre>
- Added Lighting Preview
	- Simulate Source's iconic lighting right inside the editor
	- High accuracy and reasonably fast when compared to VRAD
	- Efficiently multithreaded, the more threads your CPU has the faster it will be
	- Dynamic, fast updating of point lights and spotlights is supported
	- Bakes can be done globally (full bake) or only in a certain radius
	- Options configurable include:
		- Dynamic Updating: Toggle automatically updating when changing a point light or spotlight
		- Update Delay: The delay in seconds before updating automatically
		- Texlight Filename: Custom .rads file used for texture lights. The lights.rad and .rad file is loaded automatically
		- Sun Samples: The quality of sunlight, higher is better but slower
		- Ambient Samples: The quality of ambient environmental lighting, higher is better but MUCH slower
		- Visibility Samples: The quality of visibility testing for lights, higher is more accurate but much slower
		- Light Radius Scale: Multiplier for how far a light can "see". Lowering this can make bakes faster but less accurate
		- Light Brightness Scale: Multiplier of brightness for all lights
		- Ambient Occlusion Scale: If non-zero, ambient occlusion will be baked. This is expensive, so it's off by default!
		- Bounced Light: Bounces light so areas that a light can't see will still receive light. Only re-baked on full bakes
		- Light Bleed Hack: Attempts to fix light bleeding through walls due to the nature of Hammer geometry
		- Cubemap: Toggle rendering of the cubemap, as it can be distracting in certain situations
	- Current limitations:
		- Dynamic updating of geometry doesn't exist yet, use radius bake for now
		- Instances are not supported (soon)
		- Texture shadows are not supported
		- Detail sprites and ropes show as fullbright
		- CSGO: cascaded shadow mapping (CSM) is not rendered (soon!)
