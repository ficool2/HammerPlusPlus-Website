						I haven't worked on the project much because of study occupying my time and burnout.<br>
						However due to Team Fortress 2's 64-bit update releasing, an early update was needed.<br>
						This build does not have all features I wanted to release, but there is some <a href="updates.html">nice changes</a>.<br>
						I have also made the experimental builds for Garry's Mod and Left 4 Dead 2 public.<br>
						Stay tuned for an upcoming update with scripting support.
