	<h1>VBSP++</h1>	
	<pre>
VBSP++ is a modification of SDK2013 VBSP with various new features and improvements

Changelog:

- Automatically reduces brushes and brushsides usage of the map by 10-30% (MAX_MAP_BRUSHES, MAX_MAP_BRUSHSIDES)
- Automatically reduces planes usage of the map up to 40% if limit is hit (MAX_MAP_PLANES)
	- If plane limit is exceeded, VRAD++ must be used or lighting will be broken
- No t-junction limit
- No detail prop limit
- Raised overlay limit to 1024 and internal entity limit to 16384
- Added appid mounting if steam_appid.txt is present beside the exe
- Added support for mounting custom shaders in mods
- Added func_detail_blocker (like newer VBSPs)
- Added -blocksize (default is 1024)
	- Useful to compute visibility faster on open, large maps like surf (I recommend 2048)
	- Using a higher blocksize also reduces your vertex count, useful to circumvent vertex limit
- Added -allowdynamicpropsasstatic (allows props without allowstatic in propdata to be used as static props)
- Added proper support for compiling power of 4 displacements (like CS:GO)
- Added parallax_obb entity support for mods that have parallax cubemaps
- Added func_detail_illusionary (identical to func_detail but non solid)
- Added %compileNoShadows
- Added func_nobevel support
	- VBSP generates bounding box brushsides for angled geometry to improve collision accuracy
	- But a problem is that these can eat up brushsides quickly
	- Surround angled brushes with this to skip creating these extra brushsides
	- Accurate collision isn't needed for areas the player can't reach anyway (like out of bounds)
- Added -nobevel (disables brushsides for all angled geometry. I do not recommend using this, use func_nobevel instead)
- Added optimization to automatically disable vertex lighting for props with $bumpmap/$phong
	- Reduces time spent in VRAD with -staticproplighting
- Added logging if FGD has parsing errors
- Added warning if using info_lighting on dynamic entities
- Added %compileNoShadows support
- Added support for high lightmap sizes (useful for games that support -maxlightmapdim)
- Added -nohdrcubemap to not write HDR cubemaps to BSP, useful if map is compiled in LDR only
- Restored support for -maxlightmapdim and -defaultluxelsize parameters
- func_occluder, func_areaportal, func_viscluster, func_nobevel, parallax_obb no longer count towards the brush limit
- Improved clarity of some warnings and removed useless ones
- Fixed instances not collapsing correctly if FGD had unrecognized types
- Fixed smoothing groups not working on func_detail
- Fixed displacements not being rotated correctly in instances
- Fixed occluders not being collapsed correctly in instances
- Fixed missing texture cubemaps if skybox has mismatched side dimensions
- Fixed crash if an instance overflowed brush or brushsides limit
- Fixed crash if no surfaceprops were loaded
- Fixed bug where brushside count was varying depending on the CPU
Installation:

Place into your game's bin/x64/ folder (where normal vbsp.exe is)
Update Hammer's game configuration to use vbspplusplus.exe as the BSP compiler

The only supported games are 64-bit SDK2013-based games, for example:
- Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
Garry's Mod is <span class="error">NOT</span> supported.

	<h1>VVIS++</h1>	
	<pre>
VVIS++ is a modification of SDK2013 VVIS, with the main upgrade being massive improvement in compile time

Changelog:

- Huge performance improvement over normal VVIS. Speed up ranges from 50% to 2700% faster (!!)
-- See this <a target="_blank" href="https://i.imgur.com/AdXWITy.png">benchmark</a> image for a comparison
-- Produces the same results as normal VVIS
- Scales up to 64 threads
- Added appid mounting if steam_appid.txt is present beside the exe
Installation:

Choose the correct version for your game from the zip file:
SDK2013: Place into your game's bin/x64/ folder (where normal vvis.exe is).
Garry's Mod: You must be on the "x86-64" beta branch. Place into GMod's bin/win64/ folder

Then update Hammer's game configuration to use vvisplusplus.exe as the VIS compiler

Supported branches:

	<h1>VRAD++</h1>	
	<pre>
VRAD++ is a modification of SDK2013 VRAD with various new features and improvements

Changelog:

- Scales up to 64 threads
- Small performance optimizations
- Shared LDR/HDR compiling:
	- VRAD++ now always compiles in HDR mode
	- LDR lighting data will be redirected to HDR at no extra file size cost
	- This means you don't need to compile VRAD twice for LDR and HDR users anymore (compatible with both)
	- Passing in -ldr will still explicitly compile in LDR mode only
	- HDR data will not be remapped if LDR data is already present
	- Therefore if you need different LDR and HDR lighting, compile with -ldr and -hdr separately
- Bypassed "numplanes + fakeplanes >= MAX_MAP_PLANES" limit
	- You will never see it again!
- Added appid mounting if steam_appid.txt is present beside the exe
- Added ambient occlusion baking
	- Custom implementation that is an order of magnitude faster than AO in Slammin/CS:GO (!)
	- Set -ambientocclusion to enable this
	- Customize with -aoradius, -aoscale, -aopropsamples, -aofacesamples
	- Samples are automatically adjusted for -fast and -final mode
	- Default AO radius and scale is 32 units and 0.5 respectively
- Added -reflectivityscale
- Added -worldtextureshadows
	- Allows $alphatest brush textures to cast proper shadows like props
	- Requires -textureshadows
- Added -translucentshadows
	- Similar to -worldtextureshadows but for $translucent brush textures
	- Requires -textureshadows and -worldtextureshadows
- Improved vertex lighting for props
	- Added -StaticPropIndirectMode to use old behavior if desired
	- See <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/pull/1345">this page</a> for a comparison
- Redundant vertex lighting is skipped for lightmapped props (saves compile time and file size)
- .dx90.vtx data is loaded for vertex lighting instead of .dx80.vtx
- Broken vertex data for props will now be skipped over when compiling
- Fixed bug where broken vertex data in props skipped vertex lighting for other props
- Named or styled lights are now sorted by brightness priority for faces
	- Reduces occurence of bad lighting from overlapping named/styled lights
- Added -scale, -ambient, -dlight, -sky, -notexscale, -coring debug options
- Unlimited texlight support in .rad files
- Comments in .rad files are now skipped
- Cleaned up formatting of some messages and warnings

Installation:

Place into your game's bin/x64/ folder (where normal vrad.exe is)
Update Hammer's game configuration to use vradplusplus.exe as the RAD compiler

The only supported games are 64-bit SDK2013-based games, for example:
- Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
Garry's Mod is <span class="error">NOT</span> supported.
